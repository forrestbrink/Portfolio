      Hangman is a simple game that usually involves one player coming up with a random word, and another player guessing letters in the word or the entire world.  For every right guess, the correct letter is placed into the word.  For every wrong guess, a body part belonging to a man will be placed until the entire man exists, in which case they have lost.  While creating this program, I first had to create a word bank of words to be used in the game, as well as a random generator to pull a word from that bank.  This program is mostly made of loops and if statements.
